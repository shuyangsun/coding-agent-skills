# coding-agent-skills

General-purpose, repo-agnostic skills for LLM coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini, and others).

## Layout

- `skills/` — the canonical home for every skill. Each skill is one directory containing a `SKILL.md` plus any helper scripts. Add new skills here.
- `.agents/skills/` — agent-neutral runtime directory. Each entry symlinks to the matching directory under `skills/` (e.g. `.agents/skills/export-coding-session -> ../../skills/export-coding-session`).
- `.claude/skills` — symlinks to `.agents/skills` so Claude Code picks up the same set.

## Consuming this repo from another project

This repo is meant to be downloaded, copied, or added as a Git submodule, then symlinked into a host project's agent skill directory (under `.agents/` or `.claude/`). Because of that, skills must stay repo-agnostic:

- No hardcoded absolute paths, usernames, or assumptions about the host project's VCS or directory structure.
- Helper scripts resolve the working repo root themselves (Git → Jujutsu → current directory) and create any output directories they need, so they run correctly regardless of where `skills/` is symlinked from.
- Skills reference their own bundled scripts relative to the skill directory the runtime loaded, not a fixed `.agents/` or `.claude/` path, since either (or a different host-project path) may be the install location.

## Formatting

Markdown (and other supported files) are formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io), pinned to an exact version in `package.json` and run with [Bun](https://bun.sh).

```sh
bun install        # install Prettier + lefthook, then wire up VCS hooks
bun run format     # format everything in place
bun run format:check   # verify formatting without writing (use in CI)
```

Prettier config lives in `.prettierrc.json`; `.prettierignore` excludes dependencies, lockfiles, and verbatim documents. Prose wrapping and embedded-code formatting are disabled so exported session transcripts stay faithful to the original.

### Pre-commit formatting (Git and Jujutsu)

`bun install` runs `scripts/setup-vcs-hooks.sh` (via the `prepare` script), which configures whichever VCS the clone uses. You can re-run it any time with `bun run setup:hooks`.

- **Git** — [lefthook](https://lefthook.dev) installs a `pre-commit` hook (see `lefthook.yml`) that runs Prettier on staged `*.md` files and re-stages the result.
- **Jujutsu** — jj has no commit hooks (commits are implicit and must stay fast), so the script configures `jj fix` to run Prettier on Markdown instead. Format changed files with `jj fix` (e.g. `jj fix -s @`). jj stores this config per-clone outside the repo, which is why the setup script must run after each fresh clone.
