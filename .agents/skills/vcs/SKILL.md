description: Load at the START of new repo work, BEFORE you change any file, so
  you isolate the work in your own workspace/worktree first — and again BEFORE
  any commit, merge, rebase, or publish. Works in any VCS (Jujutsu or Git).
---

# VCS

**Isolate before you edit.** For any new work, do not change a single file in
the checkout you were handed. First understand the task well enough to name it
`<ide>-<work>` (e.g. `claude-fix-auth-retry`), then create your own
workspace/worktree (§2) and work there. The one exception: a dedicated cloud/PR
session, where you already have your own clone — then skip isolation.

Then follow this skill for every commit, merge, rebase, and publish too, in
whatever version-control system the repo uses.

## 1. Detect the mode first - before any VCS action

Run `jj root` (or look for a `.jj/` directory).

- **It succeeds -> Jujutsu (jj) mode.** Use jj for everything, **even though Git
  commands also work** — a colocated repo has both `.git` and `.jj`, and a naive
  "is this Git?" check picks the wrong tool. jj is the right tool whenever jj is
  present.
- **It fails / no `.jj` -> Git mode.** Plain Git, including a Git _worktree_ (where
  `.git` is a file pointing into a parent repo). Use Git.

Stay in that mode the whole session and re-confirm it before you publish; never
cross tools (don't run jj in a Git repo, or fall back to raw git in a jj repo).

## 2. For standard flows, run the helper first

Do not spend tokens re-deriving the routine command chain. The bundled helpers
detect the mode and run the standard Git/jj mechanics. Use prose judgment only
when a helper stops for semantic conflict resolution or reports an unexpected
condition.

- **Starting new local work:** from the checkout you were handed, run
  `bash <skill-dir>/scripts/isolate.sh <ide>-<work>`, for example
  `bash <skill-dir>/scripts/isolate.sh codex-fix-auth-retry`. If it prints
  `NEXT_CWD=...` (it created a fresh workspace/worktree), `cd` there **before you
  edit, read, or run anything else** — every command for this work runs from that
  path, not the checkout you started in. Creating the workspace but staying put
  silently writes into the shared checkout. If instead it prints `CREATED=no` you
  are already isolated; work in place. In a dedicated cloud/PR session you already
  have your own clone; skip isolation.
- **Landing committed work on shared `main`:** run
  `bash <skill-dir>/scripts/integrate.sh <branch-or-bookmark>`, for example
  `bash <skill-dir>/scripts/integrate.sh agent-2`. If it prints
  `VCS_CONFLICT=...`, resolve only the listed files using the conflict etiquette
  below, then rerun
  `bash <skill-dir>/scripts/integrate.sh --continue <branch-or-bookmark>`.

`integrate.sh` handles the no-ambiguity finish steps: Git fetch/rebase/push retry,
safe additive Git conflict cleanup for text/JSON files, deterministic
higher-version scalar tie-breaks in config files, jj merge formation, stale
workspace recovery, `main` movement checks, `jj git export`, merged
branch/bookmark deletion when no real remote backs it, parking jj `default` on
`main`, retiring landed jj agent workspaces, and auto-resolving jj conflicts that
are mechanically additive and structurally valid. If it prints `NEXT_CWD=...`,
run any later shell command from that live directory because your jj workspace
was intentionally removed.

## 3. Conflict etiquette

When the helper stops for conflicts, the agent's job is semantic resolution:

- Union every additive change. Keep every changelog entry, list/array element,
  and code block that any side added. Do not drop teammates' work.
- For a single-valued field set to different values, keep the higher value.
  Compare values directly; do not rely on "ours" or "theirs" labels.
- Never resolve a whole file with one side (`ours`, `theirs`, `-X ours`).
- Remove every conflict marker: `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`, `|||||||`.
- jj conflicts are diff-style. Drop marker/header lines such as `<<<<<<<`,
  `%%%%%%%`, `\\\\\\\`, `+++++++`, and `>>>>>>>`. If a real content line appears
  with a leading marker prefix like `+- streaming export (...)`, keep the content
  line without that extra marker prefix. When `integrate.sh` prints a
  marker-stripped preview, use it to inspect candidates faster, but still verify
  the final file yourself. For purely additive conflicts, you may apply the
  preview with the printed `conflict-preview.py --write ...` command, then inspect
  structured files and adjust any single-valued fields before `--continue`.
- After editing, rerun the helper with `--continue`; do not invent extra
  publish/cleanup commands unless the helper failed.

## 4. Fallback docs and commits

Detailed fallback markdown lives beside this file. Do not read it up front. Open
the matching fallback only if a helper is missing, reports an unexpected setup
problem, or you are authoring/editing a commit message.
