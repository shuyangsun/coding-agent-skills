description: Version-control etiquette for coding agents — detect the VCS mode
  (Jujutsu vs Git), isolate new work in your own workspace/worktree (named
  <ide>-<work>) for safe parallel-agent collaboration, land work on a shared
  main, resolve merge conflicts by union, and format commit messages. Load this
  at the START of almost any repo task: before you change a single file for new
  work (so you isolate first), and before any commit, merge, rebase, or publish.
  When in doubt, load it — nearly all coding work touches version control.

# VCS

Follow this for every commit, merge, rebase, and publish, in whatever
version-control system the repo uses.

## 1. Detect the mode first - before any VCS action

Run `jj root` (or look for a `.jj/` directory).

- **It succeeds -> Jujutsu (jj) mode.** Use jj for everything, **even though Git
  commands also work** — a colocated repo has both `.git` and `.jj`, and a naive
  "is this Git?" check picks the wrong tool. jj is the right tool whenever jj is
  present.
- **It fails / no `.jj` -> Git mode.** Plain Git, including a Git _worktree_ (where
  `.git` is a file pointing into a parent repo). Use Git.

Stay in that mode the whole session and re-confirm it before you publish; never
cross tools (don't run jj in a Git repo, or fall back to raw git in a jj repo).

## 2. For standard flows, run the helper first

Do not spend tokens re-deriving the routine command chain. The bundled helpers
detect the mode and run the standard Git/jj mechanics. Use prose judgment only
when a helper stops for semantic conflict resolution or reports an unexpected
condition.

- **Starting new local work:** from the checkout you were handed, run
  `bash <skill-dir>/scripts/isolate.sh <ide>-<work>`, for example
  `bash <skill-dir>/scripts/isolate.sh codex-fix-auth-retry`. If it prints a new
  `WORKSPACE=...`, `cd` there before editing. In a dedicated cloud/PR session you
  already have your own clone; skip isolation.
- **Landing committed work on shared `main`:** run
  `bash <skill-dir>/scripts/integrate.sh <branch-or-bookmark>`, for example
  `bash <skill-dir>/scripts/integrate.sh agent-2`. If it prints
  `VCS_CONFLICT=...`, resolve only the listed files using the conflict etiquette
  below, then rerun
  `bash <skill-dir>/scripts/integrate.sh --continue <branch-or-bookmark>`.

`integrate.sh` handles the no-ambiguity finish steps: Git fetch/rebase/push retry,
jj merge formation, stale workspace recovery, `main` movement checks, `jj git
export`, merged branch/bookmark deletion when no real remote backs it, parking
jj `default` on `main`, retiring landed jj agent workspaces, and auto-resolving
jj conflicts that are mechanically additive and structurally valid. If it prints
`NEXT_CWD=...`, run any later shell command from that live directory because your
jj workspace was intentionally removed.

## 3. Conflict etiquette

When the helper stops for conflicts, the agent's job is semantic resolution:

- Union every additive change. Keep every changelog entry, list/array element,
  and code block that any side added. Do not drop teammates' work.
- For a single-valued field set to different values, keep the higher value.
  Compare values directly; do not rely on "ours" or "theirs" labels.
- Never resolve a whole file with one side (`ours`, `theirs`, `-X ours`).
- Remove every conflict marker: `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`, `|||||||`.
- jj conflicts are diff-style. Drop marker/header lines such as `<<<<<<<`,
  `%%%%%%%`, `\\\\\\\`, `+++++++`, and `>>>>>>>`. If a real content line appears
  with a leading marker prefix like `+- streaming export (...)`, keep the content
  line without that extra marker prefix. When `integrate.sh` prints a
  marker-stripped preview, use it to inspect candidates faster, but still verify
  the final file yourself. For purely additive conflicts, you may apply the
  preview with the printed `conflict-preview.py --write ...` command, then inspect
  structured files and adjust any single-valued fields before `--continue`.
- After editing, rerun the helper with `--continue`; do not invent extra
  publish/cleanup commands unless the helper failed.

## 4. Fallback docs and commits

Detailed fallback markdown lives beside this file. Do not read it up front. Open
the matching fallback only if a helper is missing, reports an unexpected setup
problem, or you are authoring/editing a commit message.
